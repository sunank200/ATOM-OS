keyboard driver, nic driver can be implemented as separate tasks. 
Key board driver can go for sleep also, but will be for a short period usually.
spinlock is used along with other synchronization tools such as lock, 
recursive lock, and event objects. Spinlock is also used to maintain list 
of owned synchronization objects of a thread. No where else spinlock should 
be used.

When a thread is being terminated and another is waking up the same thread
there is a conflict about finding the thread on the sleep channel. The 
terminator should test the sleep channel in non-blocking way. if it fails to 
test the sleep channel or if it cannnot find the thread on the sleep channel, 
then it should restart the termination again. 
The waking up thread during waking time, unsets the sleep channel for the 
target thread at that time uses the spinlock.
