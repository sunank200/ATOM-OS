>Network card</TD
><TD
>Yes</TD
><TD
>Emulates an NE2000 compatible network card.  On Windows NT/2000,
    Linux, FreeBSD, and NetBSD, Bochs will forward packets to and from the
    operating system so that the guest OS can talk on the physical network.
    Unfortunately, on some platforms the guest OS can talk to any machine on
    the network BUT NOT the host machine.  On Windows and on systems that
    allow the TAP or TUN/TAP interface, there is no such limitation.  Often
    the host machine may be configured so the guest OS has access to the
    internet. On MacOSX, you may download the TUN driver from:

>Parallel Port</TD
><TD
>Yes</TD

>Parallel port emulation was added by Volker Ruppert for Bochs 1.3.
    Data that is sent to the parallel port by the guest OS can be saved into a
    file or sent directly into the parallel port device (Unix only).
    </TD

><TR
><TD
>Serial Port</TD
><TD
>Yes</TD
><TD
>The serial port (single 16550A UART emulation) is usable, on GNU/Linux,
    NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD and MacOSX as host and guest. On other OSes the
    emulation is present, but the connection to hard- or software of the host is
    not implemented yet. Up to 4 ports are available.
    </TD

><TR
><TD
>Gameport</TD
><TD

><TR
><TD
>PCI</TD
><TD
>Yes</TD
><TD
>Emulates most of the i440FX PCI chipset. The Host-to-PCI bridge
    (PMC/DBX), the PCI-to-ISA bridge and the PCI IDE controller (PIIX3) are
    available. For PCI cards there are 5 PCI slots supported.

>Simulate a Multiprocessor</TD
><TD
>Yes</TD
><TD
>Bochs can be configured to simulate up to 8 processors.  This
    feature is still experimental, but it can boot Linux 2.2 kernels with SMP
    support.  Please note that this does NOT mean that Bochs can run
    faster on a physical SMP machine.
    </TD
></TR
><TR
><TD
>Take advantage of your SMP box</TD
><TD
>No</TD
><TD
>At present, Bochs does not use threads or parallel processing, so it
    will not run any faster on multiprocessor hardware.

><TR
><TD
>Copy and Paste</TD
><TD
>Yes</TD
><TD
>Depending on the host platform, the text-mode screen text can be
    exported to the clipboard. Text in the clipboard can also be pasted, through
    Bochs, to the guest OS, as simulated keystrokes.
