Wellcome to Atom OS!

Actual OS is very small one which runs under bochs emulator.
Bochs (PC System Emulator), Nasm (Assembler) and MSDOS Hard 
Disk Image, Floppy disk image with the Atom OS are occupying 
the most of the space. Atom OS alone occupies only < 1 MB.
Such a small OS. 

Directories:-

base	: Main kernel files of Atom OS
bochs	: Bochs PC Emulator software
bochsimg: Bochs emulator hard disk, floppy disk images ...
bootldr	: 512 byte, floppy disk boot loader program
imgcopy	: Utility program to copy files to/from 
	  floppy disk image
include	: Include files for asm and C programs.
lib	: Common library routines
nasm	: Netwide Assembler 
sample	: Some sample programs to run under atom OS

Steps to run:
From the pack diretory execute build script
# ./build

As bochs boots Atom OS, to switch from one screen to another 
use Alt-A, to display debug information use Ctrl-A.
Every program gets executed on a different screen.
Few sample set of Unix commands are provided as internal
commands of the shell. In order to execute external programs
at the shell prompt use exec command.

$ exec <extern program name> <args>

In order to boot MSDOS change the boot sequence in bochsimg/bochssrc.txt file. Hard disk is containing the MSDOS OS.

Experiment and enjoy!!
